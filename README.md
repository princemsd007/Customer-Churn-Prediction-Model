# Comprehensive Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Description

The Comprehensive Customer Churn Prediction Model is a machine learning pipeline for accurate churn prediction, featuring advanced preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and interpretation. It uses models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and SHAP for insights and Optuna for tuning.

## Key Components

### 1. **Advanced Data Preprocessing**
   - **Data Cleaning:** Missing values are imputed using KNN Imputer; categorical features are encoded appropriately.
   - **Feature Conversion:** Conversion of binary categorical variables to numerical and handling of skewed data.
   - **Handling Imbalanced Data:** SMOTE is applied to balance the dataset.

### 2. **Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Target Variable Distribution:** Count plots to visualize churn distribution.
   - **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmaps to identify relationships between features.
   - **Feature Distributions:** Histograms and KDE plots for numeric feature distributions.
   - **Churn Rate by Categorical Features:** Bar plots for churn rates across categorical variables.

### 3. **Advanced Feature Engineering**
   - **Derived Features:** Creation of features like `AvgMonthlyCharges` and `ChargesToTenureRatio`.
   - **Interaction Features:** Interaction terms like `TenureByContract` and `MonthlyChargesByServices`.
   - **Log Transformation:** Applied to skewed features to stabilize variance.
   - **Binning:** Continuous variables like `tenure` are binned into quartiles.

### 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - **Model Selection:** Includes Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
   - **Model Evaluation:** ROC-AUC score, classification reports, and confusion matrices are used for evaluation.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Stratified K-Fold cross-validation ensures generalization.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna**
   - **Optimization Strategy:** Optuna is used to find the best hyperparameters by maximizing the ROC-AUC score.
   - **Best Model Selection:** The model with the best parameters is selected and trained.

### 6. **Model Interpretation**
   - **SHAP Values:** SHAP provides feature importance and insights into model decisions.
   - **Permutation Importance:** Evaluates feature importance by measuring the impact on model performance when features are shuffled.

## Theoretical Background

### 1. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - Predicting customer churn helps businesses retain customers by identifying those likely to discontinue services.

### 2. **Machine Learning Models**
   - **Logistic Regression:** For binary classification.
   - **Random Forest:** An ensemble model that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
   - **Gradient Boosting:** Sequentially corrects errors in models.
   - **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost:** Advanced gradient boosting techniques for efficiency and scalability.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Interaction Terms:** Capture complex relationships between features.
   - **Binning and Transformation:** Improve model performance by stabilizing variance and capturing non-linear relationships.

### 4. **Model Evaluation Metrics**
   - **ROC-AUC Score:** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
   - **Confusion Matrix:** Summarizes prediction results.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Ensures model generalizes well to unseen data.

### 5. **Model Interpretation Techniques**
   - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Explains model outputs by attributing each feature's contribution to predictions.
   - **Permutation Importance:** Identifies critical features by observing changes in performance when features are shuffled.
